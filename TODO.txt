- fix move proposals in Code/main.R
- put delta2 where it belongs (its under Hyperparameters but should it?)
- make the push.dsh.jobs.py script easier to read, maybe use a parameter vector such as job.params = [waittime, dataids, targets, run.ids, iterations, additional.param]
     from this the JOB.queue is then created and I can have all important in one line
- bind edge weights to mondrian tree node instead of using a seperate lookup matrix - is it really feasable or makes things more complex?
- clean up more and simplify, are all fct. gone that I don't need?
- add the synthetic data generator? or better to leave it in one package?
