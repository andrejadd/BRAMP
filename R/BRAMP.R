#' @param  y           m-length vector with the number of 'm' observations for the target node.
#' @param  X           n-by-m matrix with 'n' nodes and 'm' observations.
#' @param  y_SAC_node  m-length vector with the spatial autocorrelation data. Can be left NULL if not used.
#' @param  xlocs       Integer defining the number of observations along the x-axis.
#' @param  ylocs       Integer defining the number of observations along the x-axis. Note that xlocs * ylocs == m.
